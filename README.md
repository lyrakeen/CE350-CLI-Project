## Requirements

The ask script requires:

- bash
- curl
- jq
- an OpenAI-compatible chat completions API endpoint

The following environment variables must be set:

ASK_API_URL
ASK_MODEL
ASK_API_KEY

## Setup

First, make the ask script executable:

```bash
chmod +x ask
```

Create a `.env` file in the project root directory.

The `.env` file must contain the required API configuration values:

```bash
export ASK_API_URL="your_api_url_here"
export ASK_MODEL="your_model_here"
export ASK_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

After creating the `.env` file, load the environment variables:

```bash
source .env
```

To verify that the variables are loaded, run:

```bash
echo $ASK_API_URL
echo $ASK_MODEL
echo $ASK_API_KEY
```

The `.env` file is used only for local configuration and should not be committed to GitHub.

## Run the Pipeline

Run the pipeline with GNU Make:

```bash
make -j
```

The `-j` option allows Make to run independent targets in parallel.

The final output will be:

```text
action.plan.md
```

## Clean Generated Files

To remove all generated markdown files, run:

```bash
make clean
```

## Pipeline Flow

```text
codebase.txt
├── quality.md   ── quality.sum.md
├── perf.md      ── perf.sum.md
└── security.md  ── security.sum.md
        ↓
concatenated.md
        ↓
refined.md
        ↓
action.plan.md
```

## How the Pipeline Works

The pipeline starts with `codebase.txt`.

In the first phase, Make runs three independent analysis targets:

- `quality.md`
- `perf.md`
- `security.md`

These targets analyze the codebase from three different perspectives:

1. Code Quality
2. Performance
3. Security

Because these files all depend only on `codebase.txt` and `ask`, they can run in parallel when the command `make -j` is used.

In the second phase, each analysis result is summarized:

- `quality.md` becomes `quality.sum.md`
- `perf.md` becomes `perf.sum.md`
- `security.md` becomes `security.sum.md`

Each summary contains exactly five actionable bullet points.

In the third phase, the summaries are combined into `concatenated.md`.

This step is done only with shell tools such as `echo` and `cat`. It does not use `ask`, as required by the assignment.

Then, `concatenated.md` is refined into `refined.md`.

Finally, `refined.md` is used to generate the final engineering action plan:

```text
action.plan.md
```

## Makefile

```make
ASK := ./ask
CODE := codebase.txt

.PHONY: all clean check-env

all: action.plan.md

check-env:

	@test -n "$(ASK_API_KEY)" || (echo "Error: ASK_API_KEY is not set" >&2; exit 1)

	} > $@

refined.md: concatenated.md $(ASK)
	$(ASK) 'Refine the following report. Keep the sections Code Quality, Performance, and Security. Remove duplicates. Keep only high-signal engineering issues. Keep the content concise and actionable.' < concatenated.md > $@

action.plan.md: refined.md $(ASK)
	$(ASK) 'Generate a final markdown report titled Engineering Action Plan. Include prioritized actions with High, Medium, or Low priority. Include effort estimate as Small, Medium, or Large. Include a clear execution order. Group actions under Code Quality, Performance, and Security.' < refined.md > $@

clean:
	rm -f quality.md quality.sum.md perf.md perf.sum.md security.md security.sum.md concatenated.md refined.md action.plan.md
```

## Notes

- `make -j` enables parallel execution.
- `quality.md`, `perf.md`, and `security.md` are created in parallel.
- `concatenated.md` is created without using the LLM.
- `refined.md` removes duplicate and low-value issues.
- `action.plan.md` is the final prioritized engineering action plan.
